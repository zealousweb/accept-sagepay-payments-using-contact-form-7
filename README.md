# Accept SagePay Payments Using Contact Form 7
The SagePay Payment system provides a secure, simple means of authorizing credit and debit card transactions from your website.
The SagePay system provides a straightforward payment interface for the customer, and takes complete responsibility for the online transaction, including the collection and encrypted storage of credit and debit card details, eliminating the security implications of holding such sensitive information on your own servers.
The plugin provides you the option to make payment only once. There is no recurring payment option available. Users can select the option to make Payment for one time since recurring transactions are not allowed.
