# Accept SagePay Payments Using Contact Form 7
The SagePay Payment system provides a secure, simple means of authorizing credit and debit card transactions from your website.
The SagePay system provides a straightforward payment interface for the customer, and takes complete responsibility for the online transaction, including the collection and encrypted storage of credit and debit card details, eliminating the security implications of holding such sensitive information on your own servers.
